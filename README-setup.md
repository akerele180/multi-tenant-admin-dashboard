# Project Setup/Installation

This project was built using vite + react typescript. By virtue of vite, a lot has been done under the hood to bootstrap the application to be a proper
react application, hence we only need to do a little.

## Steps
Kindly follow the steps in this order to avoid mixups

1. Clone the project using the web url `https://github.com/akerele180/multi-tenant-admin-dashboard.git` by typing this in your terminal:
    `git clone <https://github.com/akerele180/multi-tenant-admin-dashboard.git>`
2. In the root directory, run the command `npm install` or `npm i` to install or the necessary dependencies like the router, UI Library(shadcn), tailwindcss etc
3. Start your project using the command `npm run dev`, and you'd see your project available on `localhost:5173`
